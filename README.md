======

**Roodoo** is a free to-do list app, built using [Ruby] and [Sinatra], designed
to be run with a free [Heroku] account, for easy access anywhere and on any
device.

## Benefits

Compared to a native solution like Things or Omnifocus, **roodoo** has several
advantages:

- It's **free as in beer**. Roodoo can be run using a _free_ [Heroku] instance.
- It's **free as in speech**. Fork it, optimize it, laugh at it.
- You can **access it anywhere**. Roodoo is a web-app, meaning you can read and
  edit your to-dos anywhere you have internet access.

## Installation

    $ git clone git://github.com/mybuddymichael/roodoo.git
    $ cd roodoo
    $ bundle install --without production
    $ bundle exec foreman start web

Then go to http://localhost:5000/ and try it out.

**Roodoo** can also be run with [Pow] by simply linking it into your `~/.pow`
directory, like so:

    $ cd ~/.pow
    $ ln -s ~/Path/to/roodoo

Then simply visit http://roodoo.dev/.

(Automatic remote installation isn't finished yet, but if you're familiar with
[Heroku], you can figure it out.)
