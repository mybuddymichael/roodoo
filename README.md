tdrb
====

**Tdrb** is a free to-do list [Ruby] app, built to use a free [Heroku] account
for its backend. Tdrb can be run in a browser, or as a homescreen-optimized
mobile webapp.

## Benefits

Compared to a native solution like Things or Omnifocus, **tdrb** has several
advantages:

- It's **free as in beer**. Tdrb is can be run using a _free_ [Heroku] instance.
- It's **free as in speech**. Fork it, optimize it, laugh at it. Your to-do app
  is your to-do app.
- You can **access it anywhere**. Tdrb is a web-app, meaning you can read and
  edit your to-dos anywhere you have internet access.
- Use it **natively**. Tdrb is optimized for iPhone native-like usage. Apple
  provides awesome support for installed web apps, and tdrb takes full
  advantage.

## Installation

Tdrb is currently under alpha development. Installation instructions will be
provided at the appropriate time.
