roodoo
======

**Roodoo** is a free to-do list app, built using [Ruby] and [Sinatra], designed
to be run with a free [Heroku] account, for easy access anywhere and on any
device.

## Benefits

Compared to a native solution like Things or Omnifocus, **roodoo** has several
advantages:

- It's **free as in beer**. Roodoo can be run using a _free_ [Heroku] instance.
- It's **free as in speech**. Fork it, optimize it, laugh at it. Make it your
  to-do app.
- You can **access it anywhere**. Roodoo is a web-app, meaning you can read and
  edit your to-dos anywhere you have internet access.
- Use it **natively**. Roodoo is optimized for iPhone native-like usage. Apple
  provides awesome support for installed web apps, and roodoo takes full
  advantage.

## Installation

Roodoo is currently under alpha development. Installation instructions will be
provided at the appropriate time.
